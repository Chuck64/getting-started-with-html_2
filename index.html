      <h2>Keys To Thinking Like A Programmer</h2>
        <div class="concept-title">
          <div class = "concept">
            <h3>Procedural Thinking</h3>
              <p>Procedural thinking involves creating perfectly clear and unambiguous instructions for a computer to follow.</p>
              <p>It may be easy to tell a person how to sort a deck of cards, but getting a computer to do that requires more thought.</p>
              <p>But once you've learned to think this way you'll find that computers can do it much faster.</p>
            <h3>Abstract Thinking</h3>
              <p>
                Abstract thinking means finding similarity, or as programmers would say, generality amongst seemingly different things.
              </P>
              <p>
                In this Nanodegree you will visit hundreds of Udacity web pages. It would be impractical for a programmer to specifically program each of these pages individually.
              </P>
              <P>
                The Udacity programmers used the power of what's called abstraction to avoid unnecessary repetition of work.
              </p>
            <h3>Systems Thinking</h3>
              <p>
                Systems thinking happens when you break a big problem down into smaller pieces.
              </p>
              <p>
                Programmers do this when they create a plan (often on paper) for how a program will work.
              </p>
              <p>
                It involves big-picture thinking and decision-making about a problem and how different pieces of a program can work together to solve it.
              </p>
              <p>
                If this is unclear now, don't worry! You'll understand what this means much more clearly by the end of the Nanodegree.
              </p>
            <h3>Technological Empathy</h3>
              <p>
                "Technological empathy" comes in many forms. For example, computer empathy is the ability to understand what a computer is, how it works, and what it's good and bad at doing.
              </p>
              <p>
                A computer is a tool, as are the programs we use and the programming languages used to write them.
              </p>
              <p>
                It's almost impossible to program anything substantial without a basic understanding of how these tools work.
              </p>
            <h3>Debugging</h3>
              <p>
                Debugging is a systematic process of relentlessly identifying the cause of a computer program that doesn't work.
              </p>
              <p>
                When a program doesn't work, it's because there is a mistake (also known as a "bug") somewhere in the computer code.
              </p> 
              <p>
                Since these mistakes are an unavoidable part of programming, every good programmer has a system for fixing them and that system usually looks something like this:
              </p>
              <p>
                <l1> Collect evidence (what makes this program fail?)</l1>
                <l2> Generate theories (what may have caused this problem?)</l2>
                <l3> Test those theories (if my theory is correct, how could I find out?)</l3>
                <l4>  Fix the problem</l4)
              </p>

            <h3>Webpages, Documents, and Structure</h3>
              <p>
                In part 1 you will develop enough technological empathy to understand what happens when you open (or create) a web page.
              </p>
              <p>
                Basic understanding of how the internet work
              </p>    
              <p>
                Clear explanation of how users, computers, servers, http, and the internet all fit together.
              </p>
              <p>
                First, recall the two main topics covered in this lesson.
              </p>
              <p>
                Overview of the Internet: You were shown the big-picture view of how the internet works and were introduced to terms like servers, browsers, the internet, and HTTP.
              </p>
              <p>
                Introduction to HTML: You were introduced to HTML tags like &ltb&gt, &ltp&gt, and &ltem&gt and saw how even though these tags aren't visible to users of a web page, they still carry meaning that is meaningful to web browsers.
              </p>
            <h3>What a Web Page Is</h3>
              <p>
                A web page is a text document written in a language called HTML.
              </p>
              <p>
                Web browsers read these documents, and then interpret and display them.
              </p>
            <h3>How Coding Works</h3>
              <p>
                Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.
              </p>
              <p>
                The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, the computer might do this by making text like this:
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm <em>&ltb&gtlearning &lt/b&gt</em> to code!
              </p>
              <p>
                I can turn <em>that code in to a form like this:</em>
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm <b>learning</b> to code!
              </p>
              <p>
                How about putting an image on your page? No Problem.
              </p>
              <p>
                <img src="http://www.mrwallpaper.com/wallpapers/beach-palms-sandbank-2880x1800.jpg" alt="Beach" height="100" width="100">
              </p> 
          </div>

            <h3>Structure</h3>
              <p>
                HTML works on tree like structure.<br> The broweser interprets tags as structure elements.<br> Using your browser developer window you can see the tree like structure of a page.<br>
              </p> 
            <h3>Everything is a box</h3>
              <p>
                Picture everything as a box on a page.<br> <a href="https://www.<br>udacity.<br>com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721-nd/l-3555039510/m-2875028536">This video from Jaques paints the picture well</a>
              </P>
            <h3>Html, CSS, DOM</h3>
              <p>
                Html - This is the language of the web<br>
                CSS - This is the style of the web<br>
                DOM - This is the tree structure the computer uses to understand the webpage generated from the HTML tags. DOM turns tags into elements that the DOM uses to structure the page.<br>
              </p>      
            <h3>Using a Text editor to program.</h3>
              <p> 
                This was the hard part. Had to take a couple of hours just to figure out the Sublime Text 2 editor.
              </p>
              <p>
                It certainly makes it easy but it does not spell check yet. What the heck is package control?
                Took me forever to learn how to get code to display in a browser. At the end of the day this was my code. It took alot longer than that.
